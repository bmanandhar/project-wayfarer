## GA Project 3

This was our third project at General Assembly San Francisco, a full time web development course. It was completed by Harry, Bijaya and Clarence during week 10. 

Heroku Link: https://react-wayfarer-front.herokuapp.com

## Brief

Build a full stack web application with full CRUD functionality using the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js). Wireframes and colour schemes were chosen by our instructors, but all the programming was down to us. 

__Timeframe:__ 1 week. 

## Concept

Wayfarer is a travel blog. Users can create an account to share a picture and description of their favourite places they've visited around the world. 

## Features

Registered users can: 

* Create a blog, including an image.
* Browse blogs about various cities.
* Edit and Delete their blogs.

## Build Process

The coloured lines drawn over the wireframes were our interpretation of different components.

## Lessons Learned

Working in a group can be a challenge, particularly in terms of merging and resolving conflicts with git. Much of our week was consumed by resolving conflicts, something that could have been avoided with better preparation and communication. This is something we wish to improve on in future group projects. 

Additionally, we should have encorporated Bootstrap from the very start. Implementing Bootstrap after I had constructed and styled the forms meant I had to restart on them.
